# Balatro Versus Server

![build](https://github.com/Rubyboat1207/balatro-vs-server/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg) 

This is the dedicated server for the balatro versus mod. Currently it is required to have a dedicated server to play, but someday I'll implement P2P connections or have a central server to make lobbies in.
